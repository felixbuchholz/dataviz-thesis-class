# Universal Basic Income. (Finally) A Topic of our Time?

If I had to write an abstract right now:

My thesis intents to contextualize current discussions around the idea of an universal basic income (UBI) in their historic, social and political background. I want to analyze and visualize qualitative and quantitative arguments of proponents and critics to identify the common grounds_*_ as well as conflicting convictions. In comparison to times of historic interest in UBI, I want to highlight and argue why the contemporary discussion of the idea are at least partially symptoms of recent technological, economical and social developments and how that could change itâ€™s political feasibility. I see this work as a continuation of my earlier projects in this program where I focused on research on poverty, income and wealth inequalities and like those projects the visualizations are intended for a broad audience interested in the political debate enough to spent some amount of time to explore the work.

## Suggested questions from the Thesis Writing Guidelines:

- What is the general (cultural, social, political, aesthetic, theoretical ...) meaning of your project?
- What kind of a contribution does it give to the field in question?
- How is your project related to earlier works on the field (who or what have been your most important influences)?
- To whom is the project addressed?

**- Who/what does your project represent? How can the data be rigorously generalized to offer meaning beyond the data points you collected?**
**- What are your primary data structures, how did you optimize, and does it sustain into the future?**

### NOTES

_Keep in mind on the data site of the project to work with APIs, or a backend to not work by hand on the data._
