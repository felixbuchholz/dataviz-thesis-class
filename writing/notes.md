Parsons School of Design Thesis Project on UBI

Dear Richard Pereira,

I hope this message finds you well.

I just read your chapter on financing UBI in Canada with great interest. My name is Felix Buchholz. I'm currently doing research for my thesis project for my Master of Science degree in Data Visualization at Parsons School of Design (NY). 

My initial research direction is to find out if the contemporary discussion of universal basic income differs from historical ones and if this is at least partially due to technological, economical and social developments in the last decades and ultimately speculate if that could change it’s political and economic feasibility.

Regarding your chapter I have three questions. 

- Would you agree that the calculation would have been different historically, for example in the 1960s and 70s when interest in UBI was high? Where could I access data in this regard?
- Do you think a similar method could be applied in the US?
- Currently these calculations are a very laborious process. Do you think there is a way to abstract them in a way that could make use of publicly available data and make a computational cross-country comparison possible?

I hope it’s not overreaching to contact you in this way. This research is a continuation of previous projects on income and wealth inequalities and I would be very much interested in contributing to the research around UBI by leveraging the methods of my discipline.

I’m eager to receive your feedback. Thank you.

Sincerely,
Felix Buchholz

## To Andrew Yang

Dear Andrew Yang,

I hope this message finds you well.

I just finished (or almost finished to be honest) your book and I think it’s amazing. My name is Felix Buchholz and I’m currently working on a thesis project on UBI for my MS degree in Data Visualization at Parsons School of Design. I’m especially interested in how the current debate around UBI is different from discussions in the 60s and 70s and how technological, economical and political developments in the last decades have contributed to that. For me as an international student your book is a great overview to understand the recent history of the US and delivers the soundest ideas to deal with its current problems. 

I wanted to reach out to you because I think one central point in my thesis should focus on the changing job market and job loss due to automation as one new aspect to UBI and I would love to hear your opinion, what kind of publicly available data you would focus on to make a strong argument for UBI?

I think it’s also a great opportunity that could contribute to the campaign, if you’re interested to cooperate on a data-driven visual narrative for UBI. I’d be happy to send you references and an overview of previous projects.

I hope twitter is the right channel to reach you in this concern. I wasn’t sure – I don’t really use twitter usually. 

I’m eager to receive your feedback. Thank you.

Best regards,
Felix Buchholz
