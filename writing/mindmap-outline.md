- Do sizes make sense?
- What’s a valuable thing that can be divided into equal parts?
- UI idea: hovering over numbers in texts gives you a tool-tip comparison
- Want to have explanations for technical terms and want to be addressed in ordinary language
- UI idea: same as for numbers: a tool-tip explains technical terms and abbreviations
### Policy makers

  - Could be new information
  - Could be a new connection / presentation of already known information

- Already know a lot about the subject
- Want to see a solid & sound argument for UBI
### UBI critics

## Arguments
### Re-group the arguments
#### Consequential: 
“positive“ or “negative” effects on the economy or society in the domains of productivity, efficiency, participation in the workforce, bargaining power, education, health, equality, level of freedom
#### Deontological: 
“moral” or “ideological” or “market” imperative arguments for or against UBI
### For
- Effects on labour
- “… UBI can mitigate, helping make currently unpaid (or underpaid) labour paid (or fairly paid) and thereby increasing personal income and income tax revenue.” (Pereira2017, p. 38)
- Eliminating disincentivizing implicit marginal tax rates
- Jobs will have to be more attractive
- Counter-argument to people won’t work anymore
- Hope that the ability to take risks, due to a safety net will encourage people to entrepreneurship (Yang2018, p. 158)
- Increased income tax revenue
- Freedom
- No one is forced to do work, that they don’t want to do (de-humanizing work, un-satisfactory jobs, etc.)
- Equality / Emancipation
- UBI is a way to compensate for currently unpaid work or work that’s impossible to compensate for in our current system (Ref: Van Parijs, I think)
- No one is forced to team up (Women leaving their husbands is actually a good thing
- The Commons
- Inherited Wealth / Income (Institutions, opportunities and thus jobs and income are in fact part of the Commons)
- Effects on the overall economy
### Against
- Questionable economic feasibility
- Questionable political feasibility
- Not sustainable
- Meritocracy, no one should be rewarded, if they do not contribute to society (That’s actually suggested by the Left and the Right.
- John Rawls and the Surfers in Miami
- Hershman
- Perversity
- Futility
- Jeopardy
- Rising inflation
- Inflation has been low for years and even the huge amounts of money necessary after the financial crisis didn’t have a substantial effect  (Yang2018, p. 153 f)
- Some prices would rise, but technological development would make things cheaper in the long run (Yang2018, p. 154)
- Instead of gaining more freedom, people would actually be more dependent on the government
- Increased influence of / more power for big tech
- More time & attention spent on digital services
- They own the automated machines that now keep the economy running
- What about immigration? – Who can receive the UBI?
- UBI actually solve the unpaid work problem: there’s still no compensation for jobs, it’s unclear if it would raise gender equality – stay-at-home partners would still have less money compared to full-time working partners
- No one would work:
- Answer: Contradictory simultaneously held beliefs  (Yang2018, p. 153 f)
- Work is essential
- No one works if they don’t have to
- What work means needs to change fundamentally anyways in face of automation (Yang2018, p. 153 f)
- UBI means employers expect people to work for less, it would only lead to more equality towards the lower income percentiles
- Robert J. van der Veen and Philippe van Parijs: Fun jobs will face declining wages. (Yang2018, p.
