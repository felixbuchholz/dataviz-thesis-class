# UBI written thesis outline

## 20190318 Third draft

1. Abstract
2. Introduction
3. Treatment
   1. History, 1960s and current debate
   2. UBI and Varieties of Capitalism (What is better situation for a UBI, LME or CME?)
   3. Specifying four models of UBI
      1. Why four categories? – The confusion of the UBI debate
      2. Model 1 – Replacing welfare, granting as much as current spending allows
         1. Problem: Welfare trap, bureaucracy, liberty [@unitedstatesPovertyPlentyAmerican1969, ], best compromise of incentives and ease of hardship (~ Milton Friedman, check healthcare, would be part of deductions [@friedmanCapitalismFreedom2002, 192]). Negative Income Tax: post-condition is problematic
         2. Solution: Replace Welfare – introduction of a “every Dollar earned increases the income” paradigm
         3. Budget re-allocation
      3. Model 2 – Add a small amount of UBI to everything right now
         1. Applicability of case studies
         2. Case studies findings
         3. Re-allocation of resources
      4. Model 3 – UBI just above the poverty line (in fact redistribution from middle class to lower class)
         1. Problem: Poverty, scarcity mindset, limiting innovation, real equality in opportunities
         2. Solution: Raising the floor
         3.
      5. Model 4 – UBI as clear redistribution, rendering work optional (in fact redistribution from middle class **and** upper class to lower class)
      6.

##### 1.1. Ambition to address various audiences: broad public, stakeholders, researchers leads to compromise or individualized address

##### 1.2. Choice for compromise, but where and how?

##### 1.4. Design choices: look, feel & continuity in comparison to predecessors

#### 2. Asking the reader for data
