### Review

- Context: International, case studies on Australia, Norway and Swiss
- Focus: _Decent_ basic income, not interested in _regressive_ models: Models who would essentially result in a decrease in net funding/welfare, therefore health care and education should be provided on top of UBI.

  - In contrast to Charles Murrayâ€™s conception of substituting all welfare with a basic income (Ref: In Our Hands: A Plan to Replace the Welfare State (2016))

- Classifying different approaches

  - Negative income tax (NIT), would only go to people below a certain income threshold
  - Demogrant, would go to everyone and partially or completely recollected in some fashion for incomes above a specific threshold
  - A dividend, collected wealth/income of a society is distributed every year, resulting of course in changing amounts

- The authors argue for a combination of demogrant or NIT **and** dividend
