## 1. Richard Pereira (ed.), _Financing Basic Income_ 

### Reference

Pereira, Richard, ed. _Financing Basic Income. Addressing the Cost Objection._ Exploring the Basic Income Guarantee. Cham: Springer International Publishing, 2017.

### Review

_Financing Basic Income Addressing the Cost Objection, Exploring the Basic Income Guarantee_ edited by Richard Pereira is an important contribution to the Universal Basic Income (UBI) debate. Instead of the often discussed back-of-the-envelope calculations that often lead to a cost objection against UBI, this book offers in-depth analysis of three national budgets: Canada’s, Swiss’ and Australia’s. When looking at UBI proposals one always has to consider the landscape of vastly different ideas of UBI. Pereira argues for a universal grant above the poverty line and finds in his analysis that with structural reforms a UBI would even provide a slight surplus to Canada’s budget. Instead of raising (income) taxes he suggests to enforce current tax legislation and restructure pension plans. While I agree with his broad approach, critics might find it too ambitious.

_Conclusion:_ His calculations in relation to Canada’s budget will very likely be part of my thesis project. It would be great as well to adopt his method and analyze the US budget.

### (Notes)

- Context: International, Canada, Switzerland, Australia
- Focus: _Decent_ basic income, not interested in _regressive_ models: Models who would essentially result in a decrease in net funding/welfare, therefore health care and education should be provided on top of UBI.

  - In contrast to Charles Murray’s conception of substituting all welfare with a basic income (Ref: In Our Hands: A Plan to Replace the Welfare State (2016))

- Classifying different approaches:

  - **Negative income tax (NIT)**, would only go to people below a certain income threshold
  - **Demogrant**, would go to everyone and partially or completely recollected in some fashion for incomes above a specific threshold
  - A **dividend**, collected wealth/income/taxes of a society is distributed every year, resulting of course in changing amounts

- Pereira argues for a combination of demogrant or NIT **and** dividend
- Pereira critiques advocates as well as opponents of UBI for a unsubstantiated claims that UBI is not economically feasible. (Pereira2017, pp. 11 ff)
  - Previous calculation didn’t consider programs that have a similar intent as an UBI (in the broadest sense), like tax-free saving accounts (Pereira2019, p. 19)


## 2. Andrew Yang, _The War on Normal People_ 

### Reference

Yang, Andrew. _The War on Normal People: The Truth about America’s Disappearing Jobs and Why Universal Basic Income Is Our Future._ New York: Hachette Books, 2018.

### Review

Andrew Yang’s _The War on Normal People_ is tailored to his 2020 presidential campaign. Nonetheless he manages to draw a vivid (in this case _gloomy_ is probably the better description) landscape on the socio-economic development in the US and identifies major divides in this country: between the coasts and the center, between people’s level of education and the effect of economic distress. His argument for UBI is two-fold: while in face of advancing automation it’s inevitable to redefine work and it’s relation to income, UBI is not only a way to start this re-vision of work but also a tool to reverse the deterioration of socio-economic structures aside of the prospering major cities on the coasts. His proposal is quite specific: 1000 $ a month for every person between 18 and 64, it’s also part of a broader plan of actions and Yang also share remarks on financing that are quite similar to the those of the other author’s in my initial review.

_Conclusion:_ Yang definitely wants to talk to a broader audience, but each of his arguments is quite data-heavy, which sometimes is exciting to read but can become tedious. This can be a great opportunity for visualization and especially the data and speculation on job loss due to automation might be interesting in the larger argument of my thesis.


### (Notes)

- Yang often focuses on the catchy numbers in his argument, it will be necessary to follow to his sources and check on the data
- His points on the influence of scarcity on peoples capabilities are also interesting

## 3. Guy Standing, _Basic Income And How We Can Make It Happen_

### Reference

Standing, Guy. _Basic Income: And How We Can Make It Happen._ A Pelican Introduction. Penguin UK, 2017.

### Review

As one of the founders of the Basic Income Earth Network (BIEN) Guy Standing committed a large part of his work to research and advocacy for UBI which is immediately visible in his short but comprehensive introduction _Basic Income: And How We Can Make It Happen._ He elaborates on the history of the idea, the intrinsic (qualitative) and instrumental (quantitative) arguments for it but also expands the focus of most authors mainly focussing on developed countries and suggests practical paths to run pilots, case studies and outlines a path for the long run from the status quo to introducing a UBI.

_Conclusion:_ As far as I can see now Standing’s book is a great resource for the qualitative part of my argument. His application of Hirschmann’s three rules (from _The Rhetoric of the Reaction_) to the objections against UBI seem to be a good way to structure and categorize the arguments. 

### (Notes)

- Guy Standing is also for a decent UBI in the grant version

## 4. Amy Downes and Stewart Lansley (eds.), _It’s Basic Income_ 

### Reference

Downes, Amy, and Stewart Lansley, eds. _It’s Basic Income: The Global Debate._ 1st ed. Bristol University Press, 2018.

### Review

Downes and Lansley collected essays from international authors on UBI to reflect the current debate. They structured their overview in five parts, arguments for UBI, voices on the economic and political futures, critiques and objection, the next political steps and reflections on case studies. It’s hard to summarize so many different voices and I think the great benefit of this collection are the unique comments and standpoints, some of them usually more marginal in the debate.

_Conclusion:_ This is a great resource for analysis of UBi trials and unique comments that make the argument for or maybe even more importantly against UBI from a more progressive point of view. 

### (Notes)

- Trials
- Progressive objections against UBI
