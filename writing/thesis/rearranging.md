#### My approach

- Provide overview over my approach: 
  - present the policy and the outcomes and 
  - let people decide whether it’s good or bad 
  - instead of telling them what other people think is good or bad, 
  - their political beliefs will show up anyway, 
  - but are probably way more nuanced than the usual buckets

## Introducing four entry points to the UIG discussion 

For this project I want to present four entry points to the UIG discussion. Trying to avoid initial ideological biases I want to introduce each of the entry points with a problem that’s suitable to be presented with data. After the problem and the reasons why it is considered a problem are presented, I visualize how a UIG plan could be a solution to this problem. The sequence of my presentation follows a progression of the intended grant levels of different UIG plans taking into account to what extent the UIG should be granted in addition or as a substitution to current welfare programs. 

In the first model I selected the “cliff effect” of welfare benefits where an increase in market income leads to bump in net income due to lost eligibility in benefits. The grant level in this model is just as high as the amount of current welfare spending that is considered substitutable divided by the number of targeted beneficiaries (for example the 10 % of the population with the lowest incomes). This model refers to Michael Friedman’s conception of a Negative Income Tax (NIT) in is work _Capitalism & Freedom_ [@friedmanCapitalismFreedom2002]. I update his calculation with current budget spending and census data, but follow the general approach. The solution is presented as a line-graph mapping market income (earnings) to net income which shows a smooth progression as income increases in contrast to the “cliff effect” of current welfare. Each section will conclude with a graph that shows the re-allocation of budget spending, comparing current spending and a theoretical budget with the UIG implementation.

The second model includes UIG plans that are considered partial, transitionary or experimental. The problem presented in regards to this model is a data problem on a meta level, it’s not possible to completely test and predict the effects of a policy that implies such a fundamental change of transfers and taxation as a UIG does. Acknowledging the inherent limitations of the UIG research, I give an overview over currently available empirical findings and refer to the analysis of Karl Widerquist what is possible to expect from new case studies [@widerquistCriticalAnalysisBasic2018]. As possible solutions to this problem I present opt-in or transitional strategies that ease the transition from the current welfare system to a UIG model.

Most popular in current debates are models of the third category that promote a grant level that is just above the poverty line. For an adult in the US that would currently mean 1.000 $ a month or 12.000 $ annually. The problem addressed by this model is obviously poverty. While there has been a significant drop of poverty by almost a half in the 1960s, also as a result of the War on Poverty (by Lyndon B. Johnson), the poverty rates have been fluctuating between 11 and 15.2% ever since[^povertyRatesDetail], proofing that the current welfare system is inefficient to address poverty completely. With Widerquist’s model I want to visualize how a UBI would affect different income groups and practically eradicate poverty by “raising the floor” [@widerquistCostBasicIncome2017]. I also use Widerquist’s approach and visualize how much a UBI would cost “in a vacuum”. Then I introduce different proposals how this costs could be integrated in the current national budget and ideas for new ways of financing a UIG. In addition the users are given the opportunity to develop their own UIG financing scheme, which they can submit in the end and that can be rated by other readers.

[^povertyRatesDetail]: Poverty reduction was mainly driven by falling rates among Americans below the age of 18 and above the age of 65. [@WarPoverty2019, see also footnote 9]

The forth model is an expansion of the third raising the grant to a level sustaining basic needs rendering  work optional but also almost necessarily introduces the need for more re-distributive (new) ways of financing the UIG. The problem that has currently most attention addressed by this idea is that growing automation will cause a huge leap in unemployment. To address this a UIG would allow to distribute the profits of automation and allow people to pursue endeavors to contribute to society that don’t have to be in the form of a paid job, which would also ease the gaps of currently existing unpaid work.[^genderEquality]

[^genderEquality]: A qualitative argument for UIGs is the fact that there is unpaid work in the domestic space that tends to be performed by women [@parijsBasicIncomeRadical2017, 102] and is not easily transformable into paid work (for example, who would monitor the work?). A UIG would acknowledge and compensate for this difference.

As layed out in section [@sec:myApproach] I want to use a data-driven approach to design a framework where users can learn about a problem and try to solve it where a UIG approach can be one possible solution. Amongst the range of possible problems[^possibleProblems] to discuss I chose those where the consensus that it is considered a problem seems to be the broadest: the welfare trap, poverty, and growing unemployment.

[^possibleProblems]: Possible problems that could be addressed by a UIG plan are amongst others: Opaqueness of current welfare programs, complexities and administrative costs, the welfare trap and cliff effects of social benefits, gender pay gap and inequalities of unpaid work, job polarization and growing unemployment due to automation, poverty and related costs, alienation, the relation between inexistent safety nets, freedom and equal opportunities, private ownership of common goods and new justifications for economic (re-)distribution.

I then want to follow a progression from problems that allow an introduction to basic UIG concepts and models that have the most compatibilities to current welfare systems to problems that reach the limits of current welfare systems and models that introduce new ideas of financing elaborate UIG plans. 

### Model 1: Can replacing current welfare with a Negative Income Tax solve the welfare trap?

For this model I want to introduce the problem called “welfare trap” and the framework of a possible solution is Michael Friedman’s methodology of a Negative Income Tax (NIT).

#### Problem: Welfare cliff

The welfare trap describes the problem that in current welfare systems there are cliff effects when recipients are able to improve their earnings situation (market income) beyond certain thresholds they suddenly become ineligible for a benefits resulting in a drop of their net income. It is regarded a problem by advocates and critics of a UIG all over the spectrum[**TODO:references:Cato,**] and different state governments have issued reports on this problem [**TODO:ref:Pennsylvania,Illinois,Massachusetts,CBO**]. While some people argue that it puts unnecessary burden on people trying to sustain a living on their own and use the welfare trap to refute the argument of the lazy poor, others that tend to regard social welfare as an undesirable disincentive to work, denounce the fact that somebody earning more (“working harder”) should be worse off than someone earning less.
- Pennsylvania etc. (Complexity of the benefit calculation vs simple formula)

- Don’t forget bureaucracy (it’s for libertarians and egalitarians)
- From a designer’s point of view: 
  - Trying to omit the deserving / undeserving argument, although it’s not really possible
  - Lowest obstacle, barrier
- Note: Friedman argues for his plan with the alleviation of poverty, but that point is stronger with Widerquist

#### Solution: A simple NIT scheme, replacing welfare

Although Friedman didn’t argue for a complete replacement of welfare by a negative income tax, he is often referred to holding this position. I think the reason for this attribution is his methodology. – In contrast to most UBI approaches that start with a specific grant level and propose an appropriate financing scheme accordingly, Friedman identifies which elements of welfare should be replaced by a universal tax credit. He then chooses a threshold of beneficiaries[^recipientThreshold] and divides the sum of the new discretionary budget by the amount of recipients of the tax credit according to the threshold. 

[^recipientThreshold]: He mentions three possibilities: the lowest tenth, fifth or third of incomes.
