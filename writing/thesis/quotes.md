- “We do not think it desirable to put the power of determining whether an individual should work in the hands of a Government agency when it can be left to individual choice and market incentives.” [@unitedstatesPovertyPlentyAmerican1969, 59]
- “The idea of providing basic economic security to all Americans (or even just American families) is not debated today, first and foremost, because it is _unthinkable_(!). It is currently beyond the pale of American political discourse” [@steenslandFailedWelfareRevolution2007, 8] … what follows is a comparison to women’s suffrage and equal rights, the nature of unthinkable changes … the design of antipoverty policy to identify the deserving poor and separate them from the undeserving poor
- “This challenged the political, economic, and cultural status quo: it presumed that previously separate categories of the poor were morally equivalent to one another; it called into question existing definitions of ‘welfare’; it created a new category of government beneficiary (the ‘working poor’); and it rested on the premise that the labor market could not serve as the sole source of economic security for the nation’s able-bodied citizens. After the failure of Nixon’s proposal, legislators responded to the threats posed by GAI plans by creating new antipoverty programs – Supplemental Security Income and Earned Income Tax Credit – that institutionally reinforced categories that Nixon’s plan had threatened to dismantle.” [@steenslandFailedWelfareRevolution2007, 15]
