# Exercise 1

- Here are the second and first draft of my synopsis: [link](synopsis.md)

## 1. Mind map
My [mind map](mindmap/) is not fully re-structured to match the outline. For I decided to separate the purposes. The mind map suits the purpose of associative note-taking, keeping the references and what kind of evidence the audience might expect (_in general: they expect to able to trace back the source of peer-reviewed research_) …
   
## 2. Thesis outline
The [thesis outline](thesis-outline.md) is the linear and higher level abstraction of the project
   
## 3.  Visualization outline
The [visualization outline](../visualizing/visualization-outline.md) is the current storyboard. 

### Thoughts on my audience (from the [mind map outline](mindmap/mindmap-outline.md))

> ## Audience
> ### General audience
> - Need an introduction to UBI
> - Might already have an opinion on the subject but no in-depth knowledge
> - Want to have a reason to stay and learn more (entertainment / involvement
> - What would UBI mean for you?
> - Guess / give an opinion on something:
> - What monthly income would be affordable?
> - What is the poverty line?
> - Are you affected by an implicit marginal tax rate?
> - Want to have a relative comparison to understand the magnitudes of numbers
> - Pie: How much of the GDP is that?
> - Can I come up with a real world comparison of magnitudes?
> - Do sizes make sense?
> - What’s a valuable thing that can be divided into equal parts?
> - UI idea: hovering over numbers in texts gives you a tool-tip comparison
> - Want to have explanations for technical terms and want to be addressed in > ordinary language
> - UI idea: same as for numbers: a tool-tip explains technical terms and abbreviations
> ### Policy makers
> - Don’t have much time
> - Have a deeper understanding of welfare and some idea of UBI
> - Want to be able to immediately identify what flavor of UBI you are talking > about and identify your “position”
> - Want to see something they don’t know already
>   - Could be new information
>   - Could be a new connection / presentation of already known information
> ### UBI proponents,  advocates  & researchers
> - Already know a lot about the subject
> - Want to see a solid & sound argument for UBI
> ### UBI critics
> - Different levels of knowledge on UBI
> - Want their concerns to be addressed
> - Political feasibility
> - Want their alternatives to be considered
> - UBI instead of health care and public education

### What does your audience learn and take away from their user experience?

If I succeed the audience not only has a deeper understanding of UBI but I also offered the opportunity to reflect on the opinion formation process (see also the [synopsis](synopsis.md)).
