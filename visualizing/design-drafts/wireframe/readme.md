## Initial comments:

#### Basic Navigation (one possible implementation is on the last page in the pdf):

- Navigation **within** sections: by vertical scroll
- Navigation **between** sections: in a footer bar, a chain graph showing progress and a note much time is left to get to the end of the piece
- Navigation to an **overview / about**: small icon in the top right
- Navigation to **menu with collected arguments**: central in the top
- Top bar: **breadcrumbs** give orientation in textual form
